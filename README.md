# GifToBackground
A fun tool to convert a gif and then display it RUNNING as your windows background!

Very simple to use.

Download the repo
Download some GIFs
Copy the gifs into the '/gifs' folder
run the 'GifToFrame.py' script
Once it has finished, you can run the 'BackgroundGif.py' script
Select the number of the gif generated (starting from 0)
Tadaa, GIF playing on the background

This was created as a simple and quick task at school.
I wanted to set the background, but group policy disables
background setting from a students account. To prove that
it was still possible, I took it to the next level and
placed a GIF as my background. This was met with smiles
from friends.

Of course, I do not agree to the use of my script if your
pure intentions are to bypass your networks security.

Have fun.

P.S: There are no previous commits to this repo as this was created
offline and in a very timly manor. So this is just the raw upload of the code.
Any future commits will simply be bug removal, and code cleaning.
